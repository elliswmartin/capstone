You'll need to have basic street smarts such as not waving around money or electronics, strapping your purse across your body, not hanging your purse/backpack on the back of a chair in a cafe, and things like that.\n\nMost crime in Berkeley is low-level property crime such as items being stolen from cars. Like any city in the US, it's not entirely safe to walk alone at night, especially if you are petite or female appearing. \n\nThe most likely problem for you to encounter in the campus area (particularly Southside) would be harassment or aggressive behavior from a stranger on the street. There are a fair number of people who live outside in the area and some of them are mentally ill or have substance abuse problems. You may need to stay safe by not engaging, ignoring questions, avoiding eye contact, crossing to the other side of the street if necessary, etc.  This is a skill that doesn't always come naturally, especially to women who have been indoctrinated to always be polite and helpful to others.

My son was super shook and called me from a friends phone. I immediately called the Berkeley police to report the crime. The officer who took the call said this was the 4th armed robbery report in 20 minutes. Two officers then arrived at my son’s location to take the report. During this time, I communicated with my son through his roommate and told him to erase everything from his phone through Find My iPhone. It turns out the robbers did NOT turn off my son’s phone. While the officers were there, they were being notified of more incidents of armed robbery in the area (Berkeley/Oakland/Emeryville). The reported incidents coincided with the route of my son’s phone. Apparently the same gang robbed 10+ people within the hour. The police continued to track my son’s phone and dispatched a ton of police cars, plus a helicopter, and was able to make the arrest. My son and his friend were then taken in the police car to ID the robbers. Thankfully everyone’s safe. And my son was able to get his phone back (but not his credit card, IDs, and backpack). What a horrifying experience! So I went through my emails and looked at all the Berkeley WarnMe messages, and I think that it could be the same people committing all the gunpoint robberies that’s so prevalent at Berkeley these days.

University Village incident.

This guy snuck up from the side of my apartment and placed duct tape over my Ring around 9pm. I got the motion alert, ran downstairs and outside confronting the suspect. He quickly darted away behind a dumpster and into a dark grey 5th generation Ford Mustang coupe which quickly sped off. I'm not sure of the intention here, possibly to steal a catalytic converter off the cars that are in view, hopefully not something worse that involved a break-in.

In any event, keep an eye out in the future if you spot the car or this dude. White, blue eyes, in his 40s, \~5'8"", \~180lbs medium build, black zipped hoodie, grey pants, baseball cap."

“I have been living here for 20+ years and have no problems, just be smart” 
Or 
“You aré just privileged, I lived in a place that is 20x worse than here!” 
Or 
“Just walk with a friend, and be smart” 
Or 
“Just ignore/ don’t let the Warnmes get to you!” 

Please just hear me out.

I made a post earlier in the summer about it feeling unsafe, which I do think it got better now that there are students on telegraph past 10pm most of the time. However, it’s been pretty bad lately with the two robberies at gunpoint. I am a woman, and I am short,Asian etc. just because of those things does not mean I am “privileged”, you don’t even know who I am.

I want to say that what are we supposed to do other than be smart because some of us do genuinely have late commitments that simply cannot be moved (eg a decal) or like clubs and we can’t just stop making clubs at night or just not join them at al because that’s just ridiculous. I know bear walk is a great resource I just am genuinely worried and scared something is going to happen.

I can “be smart” (not look like a target, no AirPods,phone, walk with a guy,etc) but it dosnt stop Anyone from still threatening me . I guess giving up my stuff is better than dying but I am low income and it will be hard to replace everything I have . 


The reason why people might be ignorant or just thinking that we just have to deal with this, we are in a city , so it’s normal which is true, I’m just saying many are not thinking of the people that actually got robbed and how they feel. I bet those people that are making those commments would eat their words if they actually did get robbed

Idk just my thoughts

Clearly that’s unfortunately not the case here, but I just cannot understand what the end goal of these protesters is? The university offered housing to all of the residents. I’ve heard people complaining that conditions there aren’t the best, but there’s absolutely no way they’re as bad as at the park itself. Just today, three WarnMes at PP, and frequent assaults occurring in broad daylight. 

I’m not even talking about students being attacked or anything; as far as I know, the assaults are against the very people that are most vulnerable and live there (by other residents). The park is not a viable or safe living place for its own residents, let alone near the students in Unit 2 (my freshman year we had more than a couple break ins). Do the people protesting really support just keeping the park like that forever? 

A lot of it honestly just seems like blatant virtue signaling. People hop on the bandwagon despite literally never helping any of the houseless in Berkeley in any concrete way (like maybe giving someone a couple bucks or buying a water?). The residents obviously have a right to be housed and treated with dignity, but I just don’t see how keeping the park as is is in any way a viable solution. 

PLUS they’re planning to build a homeless shelter next to the dorm there anyways, which would actually help the people who are there right now, who I’m pretty sure don’t particularly like living in tents. As a last note, for those who say it’s important to honor the legacy of the park, hasn’t it been dishonoured enough by being left to turn into what it has been for the last few years?"

I don’t really take an interest and I realize that this comes from a place of privilege. My hometown does have a significant homeless population and I know that a lot of those people are chronically homeless for reasons that are not easily solvable. I do think that anti-homeless infrastructure like stuff like “armrests” is unnecessary and a bit inhumane. I don’t have a solution in mind for this type of chronic houselessness that many face.

I don’t know where they should go, and I am a bit apprehensive walking in Berkeley near the park. I’ve also seen stuff about how the shelter Berkeley is offering is not taking all the people from the park (although this is not verified). I’ve also heard things like the WarnMes make the park seem more dangerous than it actually is.

I don’t think that uprooting houseless people is the right thing to do, but the housing crisis is something that affects many students. I’ve moved twice in one year jumping from semester lease to lease, subletting just trying to find affordable housing. I’m not sure that dorm housing is that affordable either. I find that someone of the people on here feel a really strong way one way or another, and the people advocating for getting rid of the park are a lot louder recently or are calling protestors performative. I agree that what is being done now won’t likely do anything to stop the construction long-term. 

I guess what I’m asking is there a distinctly, obviously correct opinion to have here? I find whatever happens to the park as having both pros and cons. What am I missing here? Are there better, concrete solutions that Berkeley can implement to support the homeless and the student housing crisis i.e. making housing easier to find and more affordable?"

They have many student group with names like Acts2Fellowship, International Student Mentorship Program, Kairos, Koinonia, Klesis, and many other names that are ever changing. Their past names include Asian Baptist Student Koinonia or ABSK.

Sadly, I was sucked into this ""church"" during freshman year when they helped me move into Unit 1, Putnam Hall. They lured me with free food, friendships, and fun trips to Yosemite. Regrettably, this high control group ended up controlling most of my life including who my friends were, where I lived, who I lived with, who I dated (or not dated since they banned dating until they deemed you ""ready"" and I was never good enough for them) and eventually I left the organization after many painful and sleep deprived years. They discouraged me from visiting my family and taught me to give them lots of money, and joyfully at that. There's a Christianity Today article about them (just google it) under their former name Gracepoint.

Anyway, please stay away from this high control group unless you want to give over your entire life. Read their [15 principles](https://www.acts2.network/way-of-life/at-a-glance) and see if it's what you want. They literally tell you that you need to be ""willing to drop my plans to meet the needs of others, or the ministry."" Do you want to lose agency over your own life and schedule? If your answer is yes, I guess this group is for you.

Stay away from high control groups and enjoy your time at Cal!

It’s not that they aren’t there… If you are a mugger, you aren’t going to commit a crime right in front of the police, you will wait for an opportune moment when no one is around but the victim. The response time issue seems really bad until you consider the fact that police can only respond when they’ve been alerted to the crime. In most mugging scenarios the victim is left without their phone, so they can only get in touch with police through a blue light phone, flagging someone else down or going to the station in person, by which point the perpetrator is long gone. UCPD is also stretched thin right now not just because of lack of funding, but because it’s not a particularly fun place to work at the moment. The best way to stay safe at night is to travel in groups or to utilize night safety services like Bearwalk or the night safety shuttle. The reality of the situation is that muggers aren’t stupid and it’s impossible to have an officer posted in every part of an enormous campus, so the best prevention is to be smart about how you get around campus at night.', ""Police are really bad at preventing crime.

They really try to emulate the culture of investment banking/consulting, and those jobs are glorified among members. You\'d be forced to work on case projects and other busy work with your pledge brothers through the night, you\'d have to submit to tests of physical discipline (e.g. stand in a line and don\'t move for hours), you\'d have to be accompanied by pledge brothers at all times on campus, etc. It\'s all intended for you to build strong bonds with your pledge brothers and ""prepare"" you for the professional world after college.

I quit and enjoyed the rest of my semester, joined a service organization (Alpha Phi Omega), and graduated from Haas undergrad anyway.

This guy scammed me a bit differently (there are variations in this scam which I assume they change the story accordingly after feeling out the person to have the highest chance of the getting some $ from the victim). So this person gave me fake cologne claiming it was a gift since he couldn't take them back. (He probably try to sell it to other victims) Then goes on telling me about how he needed to cover expense like gas, rental cars, luggage, etc because of some bs about time zone difference in Italy. He promise he would pay me back by midnight. Unfortunately I fell for it. These people will be a fast talker, intimidating,  but also try to get the person's sympathy by being nice about it. I feel the sympathy part is how they get people to hand them money. But it's all a scam and they play this over and over again on different people.\n\nGoing forward I will be more careful when it comes to stranger. Also remember that you don't owe anyone anything like your time, an explanation, etc. So if there are strangers trying to get your attention, you can choose to ingore them if you feel suspicious. Or if you want to help them, exercise caution and be in control of the situation. Once they start telling story, generally it's a scam and it's time to go, no need to stick around. No need to feel rude about it. Especially cases like this where they start off with a seemingly simple question, it can escalate into a full blown story really fast. There's a reason they don't start off by asking for money like most common panhandler, because our first reaction is to say no."", 'I almost got scammed by the exact same guy today. Exact same story. Nordstrom, lighter to prove leather jacket, fake rolex watch as a collateral.']","My boyfriend got scammed today Southside by an Italian guy who claimed to work in high fashion. 

He was looking for directions to the airport to fly back to Italy after being here for two weeks for a couple of events. He said he needed $3200 in cash to pay off his rental car because he just hosted a big event with his credit card and the credit card company was waiting 24 hrs before letting him make another charge with it. 

He said he would pay him back tomorrow by sending money to his bank account through Zelle.  He also offered my boyfriend “collateral” in the form of a watch and 5 leather jackets that he took a lighter to to “prove” that it was genuine leather. He said the jackets were unreleased and each was worth about $3500 and he could take them to Nordstrom to exchange them for cash. 

Ultimately, the jackets were a completely unknown and most likely fake brand and watch is most likely fake as well. Just wanted to share this to warn people so hopefully no one else gets scammed!

Firstly, Claremont and Piedmont have plenty of crime, but less visible crime because they are wealthy single family areas. Most student areas in most urban places are a bit rough, it’s pretty normal. Meanwhile, the USA has the highest rate of incarceration in the western world. It also makes no meaningful dent in crime if you lock people up in ever larger numbers. In fact, it seems the more you lock people up the less safe the general population feels. So this seems like a social and cultural problem that is unique to the USA, and crops up specifically around student areas. What you are advocating sounds like a policing approach, but we know thar doesn’t work. What works is higher minimum wage, better social housing and social services, free education accessible to all. This is a fact. If you really want to solve this problem, stop the blame game and change your society.', '[removed]']","Through the multiple comments I read I do realize I let my emotions over ride critical thinking. I will take the criticisms constructively and try to voice my concerns more rationally. 

**On peoples park ;**

First of all, yes the crime yesterday had nothing to do with homeless people or peoples park, and I should’ve made that clearer in my original post.

However, the park and the surrounding issue with homeless people is interconnected with crime. These issues do not exist in isolated vacuums. Save for the vocal minority who want to keep the park without helping the homeless people at all, the majority of Berkeley students are against it. This is proven by the campus survey that was taken and resulted in the approval of the building project in peoples park. 

Peoples park does not offer a haven for homeless people, it acts as a dumping ground for an “out of sight out of mind” approach to homelessness, attempting to sequester them in this area, which does not even work. The park is ridden with crime, evident by the constant warnme messages people get of crimes happening there, drug us is extremely rampant. No one can deny how many cracked out mofos come out of there walk onto Telegraph and harass and scream at people. 

One can both empathize with there condition and realize the severe danger this places on the Berkeley population. No one in this city, not even the people who were insulting me in the last post, have tried to help anyone there

**ALL OF YOU WALK BY THAT PARK AND THOSE HOMELESS PEOPLE WITH YOUR HEAD UP HIGH AND PRETEND IT DOESNT EXIST**

This is reality, and if no one is willing to fix it, (mainly I’m talking about people with real power like the city and ucpd) then the priority should be the safety of the students.

**on the crime itself**

This is not an isolated one off instance of crime, as people in my previous post have consistently pointed out, crime is rampant. Just last week a friend of mine had her car broken into and all of her belongings taken away, every other day another robbery takes places. These things don’t occur in a vacuum. I personally believe they are a direct result of the sham laws decriminalizing petty theft and allowing criminals to act out without impunity


**on ucpd**

I’m not a fucking republican yall, the police are corrupt as shit and only seek to protect their own ass and their reputation. “Funding” them does nothing, the department needs to be built from the ground up. 


**Helplessness** 

I’m just an average Berkeley student, I have no real power nor any real solutions. It’s ridiculous to expect that of me or any other student. And I don’t expect it from any of you. You know why, **BECAUSE ITS NOT OUR JOB**, thats not on us, we came here to receive an education not fix a broken fuckign city. 

The hypocrisy needs to be addressed, this problem is fixable but idk how, I just know it is because i drive up to Claremont or piedmont neighborhoods and they’re clean and safe asf to walk through. What are they doing differently that we can’t?????

It’s not a travesty to ask for safety and to criticize the current leadership that has put us into this situation. I use Reddit to air out my frustrations not to push some stupid agenda like people were insinuating in the comments, I want to have a conversation that’s all."

I will be intentionally vague with details to preserve my identity and those of all parties and individuals involved. Please do not press me for more information.

&#x200B;

My situation:

I am currently a rising junior here at Cal but my situation is a direct result of decisions that I made 3 years ago during the summer following my junior year of high school. You see, my dad wanted me to be study at a prestigious institution to become an engineer so he looked for internships for me to do. As a Cal alum, he was able to pull some strings and got an old HAAS buddy of his to give me an internship at his tourism company, which, at the time, wasn't too well-known to the average Joe. I won't disclose the name of the HAAS dude but I will say that he was the epitome of ""old money"".

&#x200B;

Anyways, at the internship, my job was to design a certain aquatic vehicle that would transport affluent tourists to their destination and back. Tbh I wasn't too enthused by the thought of spending my summer toiling for this obscure company so I half-assed my job and cut corners whenever I could despite my colleagues warning me that ""not meeting the proper safety specifications could cost lives"" ☝🏻🤓.

&#x200B;

How wrong they were...or so I thought. Up until recently, everything in the company has gone swimmingly(no pun intended) and the submersib-err...umm...I mean ""mysterious vehicle that will not be specified"" has not had any incidents. However, recently, due to my negligence, there was an oopsie of titanic (\*wink\* \*wink\* \*nudge\* \*nudge\*) proportions which resulted in the ...uhhh... disappearances of five individuals 😅 and, more importantly, my concerns about being rescinded when the university realizes that I'm responsible for the incident.

&#x200B;

In fact, I am already facing the negative repercussions of my actions, ranging from death threats from the associates of the tourists to letters of praise and admiration from Marxist groups around the world. Needless to say, I am under a lot of pressure and feel like I'm about to implode. Any insights on my chances of retaining my admission would be greatly appreciated! 😁😁😁"

They have many student groups at Cal and the names are changing frequently but as of now, they have Acts 2 Fellowship (A2F), International Graduate Student Ministry, and International Undergraduate Student Ministry. This church was formerly called Gracepoint, formerly called Berkland Baptist Church.

[Acts2 Network](https://www.acts2.network/) is their rebranded website. They have had many student group with names like International Student Mentorship Program, Kairos, Koinonia, Klesis, Asian Baptist Student Koinonia (ABSK), and Korean Baptist Student Koinonia.

Sadly, I was sucked into this ""church"" during freshman year when they helped me move into the dorms. They lured me with free food, friendships, and fun trips to Yosemite. Regrettably, this high control group ended up controlling most of my life including who my friends were, where I lived, who I lived with, who I dated (or not dated since they don't let you date until they deemed you ""ready"" and I was never good enough for them) and eventually I left the organization after many painful and sleep deprived years. They discouraged me from visiting my family and taught me to give them lots of money, and joyfully at that. There's a Christianity Today article about them (just google it) under their former name Gracepoint.

Anyway, please stay away from this high control group unless you want to give over your entire life. Read their [15 principles](https://www.acts2.network/way-of-life/at-a-glance) and see if it's what you want. They literally tell you that you need to be ""willing to drop my plans to meet the needs of others, or the ministry."" 

Do you want to lose agency over your own life and schedule? If your answer is yes, I guess this group is for you.

Stay away from high control groups and enjoy your time at Cal!

The seniors don’t have time to process the seismic waves if it happens quick (ie. Small quake).

With sufficient distance, you will get warning, but if you're close to the epicenter, you're getting no warning, no matter how big the quake is.""]","I live in Berkeley about 2-3 miles from the epicenter of the 3.9 quake this morning.  MyShake app didn't sound the alarm which I have- set at 3.5 or larger.  On the news (Chan 7) two anchor women talking about it also said they were not warned of the earthquake on MyShake and though it was originally reported as 4.0 it was reduced to 3.6 ; still 0.1 above the lowest benchmark for a warning sound.  

how does this fail. yes it was only 3.6 but will it fail to alarm all of us if it's a 7.2 or greater? and not give me 15-30 seconds or more of a warning? Earthquakes are essentially sound-waves penetrating through the ground and this is how we can have up to a minute or more  to be warned of a massive quake.  just like the crude method of gauging where lightening has struck,   for every mile or so the epicenter moves outward you count 5 seconds so a warning per mile should result in a 5 second delay per mile. so 10 miles should be 45-50 seconds or so.   I also notice  that there was no earthquake showing on the app map when I checked. then 4 hours later I got up and  I hit the refresh and suddenly there is a quake marker where there was not one before.  why didn't the app refresh automatically for me?"

This decision has been made under some assumptions, at this point though, GPA is not one of them.\n\n2) There was certainly a list of conditions of admittance that were sent to you; violating those terms is the only way to get admission revoked.\n\n3) The transcripts you provide are only to prove that you neither lied nor flagrantly disregarded your terms of admission upon receipt of the letter. \n\n4) They will not patrol your social media or any other form of outside communication to make decisions about your enrollment - if it was not contained within the application it is not considered. The only caveat is if something gets reported to the University which would have to be particularly grievous.\n\n5) Once you get here, you need to drop your bad habit of perfectionism like week old spoiled milk. The best internships and opportunities require a 3.2 - 3.3 minimum GPA, anything above that is superfluous. Your biggest, indeed only, priority at this point should be 3 subpoints: \n\n- Learn genuinely and honestly in all classes to master the material at a deep level; grok it, grades are irrelevant in interviews.\n\n-  Join clubs fanatically, especially the competitive ones. These are your doors to opportunities that are exclusive and exceptional. Not only do you meet powerful and connected allies but companies often charge these clubs with ""fun"" projects. These projects are immeasurably valuable in a portfolio. These should be considered obligatory and not optional.\n\n- Take classes, aside from major reqs, that build out your portfolio for competence. Project and team based classes are best. Pick classes where you will be working on an awesome project from start to finish to produce novelty and utility. These projects from your classes are what make Berkeley stand head and shoulders over other Universities. You might think ""it\'s just a class assignment, everyone did it though."" But you know who didn\'t do it? All of the people who didn\'t take that class at Berkeley. Your boss doesn\'t know and doesn\'t care if it was an assignment, class project or extracurricular, your boss only cares about demonstrations of competence and all of the class projects and assignments are of exceptional quality. I\'m case you care to test, imagine doing the assignment/project on your own, coming up with the idea, structuring it and then executing it perfectly. You will see just how powerful these things can be. \n\n5) If you are not making mistakes, you aren\'t taking risks. You should make many mistakes in classes and otherwise and be prepared to discuss these mistakes. Being able to explain why you made a mistake, how you never made it again and how those lessons improved everything you did from that point on is exceptionally more powerful than trying to make a case of perfection. People who did not make mistakes are either lying or afraid of learning and taking risks - employers want neither of those people. Catalog your mistakes, craft a story and build a portfolio of growth - that\'s what real achievement looks like.\n\nOther than that, welcome to Berkeley, your best shot at your best future with unlimited opportunity and possibility that you simply will not get anywhere else the way you get it here.

At the instant my grades were released, I heard a thud in my living room and some shouting. I went out to investigate and saw that my mother had swooned while my father shouted at me about bringing dishonor to the household. He warned that, if my acceptance to UC Berkeley is revoked, then I was “finished” and, quite frankly, I share his sentiments because I cannot bear to live with such a dishonorable stain on my legacy. Once my father calmed down, he shared a drink of sake and we exchanged knowing nods, aware of what would come next.

That brings us to the present. Currently, I am kneeling on the floor of my bedroom, intermittently refreshing my inbox and awaiting the dreaded message. I am holding a tanto knife in front of my abdomen while my father is standing behind me holding his katana. The instant I receive the email notifying me of my admission being withdrawn, I will commit seppuku by plunging the knife into my abdomen and moving it sideways while my father swiftly decapitates me in one swing, restoring honor to my family name.

Unfortunately, my slight inebriation has caused my determination to falter and the suspense is killing me. I’ve been kneeling here awkwardly with my father standing behind me for three hours but I just want to get it over with.

With that being said, will the university rescind me and how long can I expect to wait before receiving the email?"

If found guilt in any option we get -100% on the assignment or an F and a non reportable warning. Funny part is on the form they gave us to select the option they asked us what assignment we violated course policies on. Wouldn’t they know if they have “statistical evidence”.

Its lonely. And I’ve not had the willpower to workout. I walk a lot, like everyone else, but this is the longest I’ve gone without the gym. I need to find one ( or many) gym buddies who can do the 7-8 am ( or pm) with me and life will be sunnier.

Anyway, more power to us all. The show goes on.

Tldr: What’s been the good, bad and ugly of your first 30 days here at Cal?"

Is the housing situation on campus and in the city as bad as it sounds? Does the majority off-campus living situation detract from a sense of community on campus? Will I have to struggle to find and pay through the nose for shitty apartments after Freshman year?\n\nThe situation is pretty rough and people do end up paying a lot and having to hunt for housing. I wouldn\'t say this detracts from the community on campus at all though. If you live very far away (like miles away) from the university it might be a pain to meet up with people to get food or something, but that\'s not a big issue for most.\n\n>Next, culture. I\'ve heard that Berkeley is quite polarized between the Greek life crowd and the more nerdy kids. \n\nI think that you are kind of reinforcing stereotypes here by talking about the ""nerdy kids"". The average high school GPA of a student here is basically perfect, everyone\'s a nerdy kid lol. People shit on the Greek community a bit, but it\'s mostly restricted to online (really) here. There is no rivalry or widespread hate. Some people have reasons for hating on Greek like, but most just do it because it\'s easy too. Additionally, things you are not a part of are not going to occupy a lot of your mental space. If you aren\'t in a frat, you won\'t give them any thought. Don\'t worry about this.\n\n\n>I\'ve also heard warning of the ultracompetitive atmosphere that makes it hard to enjoy one\'s time at school. Are these accurate or overblown?\n\nThis one bothers me and really needs to die. No it\'s not competitive at all. Some majors can be hard, but people really are in it together and very collaborative. The only people who think the school is competitive are high schoolers who take advice from other high schools on /r/ApplyingToCollege who have never actually attended any university.\n\n>Last is just a question: do students tend to take advantage of Berkeley and SF on a regular basis, or do most stick closely to campus?\n\nAside from the University, Berkeley is mostly an above average Bay Area suburb. There are some nice places and some events here and there, but there\'s not that much reason to get deeper into Berkeley for most. SF has a lot more going on however. In general I would say that students underuse SF. It\'s just really easy to mostly stick around the campus when everyone you know lives there and everything you need is around there also. There is not reason you can\'t go to the city often if you want, it only takes like an hour to get there are most. That said, I am sure that plenty of students haven\'t taken a trip to SF in months.', 'I was in your position last year hearing all that shit from friends in high school and on Reddit. LOL\nIt’s the same repeat… hearing rumors before attending high school. Same for middle school. LOL \nSo I’m wrapping up my first year at Berkeley. Housing? Dorm is dorm. New experience for everyone everywhere. Assigned to Unit 3 which is the crappiest one. But have close group of floor mates. We just recently closed deal for an off-campus unit for next academic year. The Bay Area is a high demand rental area so that’s expected. I plan to stay here after graduation & for job. I’m from SoCal but I really enjoyed being here since coming here.\n\nMost don’t care much of Frats here but do attend their parties. I been to several already. Been to a few dance clubs in SF during the weekends. And visited the tourist spots and western side of SF. Also been around the Bay Area on weekends.\nThere are tons of good restaurants nearby the campus and around the Bay Area.\n\nLast and not least, it’s not ultra competitive! It very collaborative. Everyone’s on the same boat. Two or more brains is always better than one… when it comes to college study. So everyone will work together to succeed. That’s been my experience. The courses are very rigorous (especially the weeder ones) and you will learn a lot. That’ll make you succeed in the real world.\n\nMost of all, it’s how you make your experience here. Have an open mind and you’ll make it through… at Berkeley or at any school.', 'I went to Berkeley for undergrad and then UCLA for grad school. I think you should chose Berkeley. \n\nHousing and cost of living were waaaay more stressful at UCLA than at Berkeley for me. Although your housing options at ucla would be different from mine because you will be undergrad so maybe that will help. But cost of food and going out in LA was much higher. There’s no public transportation, and everything is spread out. Westwood is not that fun. If you’re really worried about housing costs at Berkeley you should check out the student co-ops. I don’t think that exists at ucla. \n\nSomeone mentioned crime and homelessness. I could see this standing out to a parent but it had no effect on my school experience. Rarely did I see homeless people on campus. There are lots and lots of homeless people in West LA. UCLA will feel more suburban though. \n\nCulture - I have many friends who majored in physics/math and never once did anybody complain it felt competitive. \n\nDo people explore surrounding area - different friend groups did different things. I think it’s much easier to explore the Bay Area than LA as a student on a budget, especially if you won’t have a car.', '> housing\n\nI mean personally I hated the dorms, and I think paying 1500+ for a triple under the guise of a ""college experience"" is one of the biggest ripoffs in existence, but I understand that that\'s a minority opinion. I\'ve seen the dorms at UCLA, they\'re just as shitty and cramped as ours. (and half of them don\'t have AC! most of ours don\'t either, but LA is significantly warmer.)\n\nYou will generally get much better deals for housing off-campus. Off-campus apartments still aren\'t great (esp for the money), and you will have to go through the process of finding your own apartment instead of just getting housing from the school, but it\'s not that bad.\n\nMany off-campus apartments are just as close to campus as the dorms, but it probably is true that it\'s easier to have a school community in typical-style dorms.\n\n> culture\n\nNo one I knew personally in college was in Greek life lol so I can\'t really comment on that, but my impression is that Greek life plays a smaller role socially here than it does at most schools. \n\nBerkeley isn\'t really cutthroat but it might lean a bit more workaholic on average than UCLA. Classes here will probably be a bit harder too. I genuinely think most of the difference between Cal and UCLA here though can just be explained by UCLA having a much higher proportion of students in chill majors. I doubt sociology or psychology majors are super stressed out here either.\n\n> Last is just a question: do students tend to take advantage of Berkeley and SF on a regular basis, or do most stick closely to campus?\n\nI didn\'t go to SF that often, but some people do, and nothing\'s stopping you from going there. it\'s a 20-30 minute train ride.', '1) Housing. Yes it’s shit but the city is pretty walkable, bikeable, and has ample public transportation so you’ll likely be close and connected to the campus. FYI “on campus” housing isn’t literally on the main campus so whether you go on or off campus a lot of times you’ll be similarly close.\n\n2) Nerds vs Greek Life. This is completely untrue lmao. In all my years at Berkeley I’ve pretty much never had to think about Greek Life. I’d wager you’re hearing this from “nerds” who vocally dislike Greek life, because most people just have their own groups and social circles. It’s a huge campus with a lot of people.\n\n3) Sf. Honestly it depends on what you want to do. I’ve been to sf embarrassingly few times but also I’ve been grinding this damn cs major. It’s very accessible so it’s completely within your reach!', ""Living off campus doesn't detract anything, the dorms are already interspersed with the city so your apartment could be just as close to campus as a dorm. Berkeley is so walkable you can walk to all your friends apartments. People don't wanna stay in dorms even if they could cuz apartments are cheaper, offer more freedom, space, and privacy. Dorms are expensive at UCLA so people may want to move off campus but the problem is Westwood is so expensive, moving off campus often means students live farther and drive to campus. I wouldn't wanna live in a dorm for 4 years no matter how nice it is. Finding housing here can definitely be stressful but in the end all my friends found places within a few blocks of campus and WAY cheaper than dorms.\n\nDefinitely not competitive at all, very collaborative and friendly, not sure where this myth even came from.\n\nCulture? Idk I don't think it's polarized, maybe on Reddit, I feel like Reddit is often toxic and not very representative of campus as a whole. I know plenty of people that are nerd in that they work super hard and have a good gpa but they're super social and still party a lot or go out plenty. A lot of the smartest people I know were also some of the most social. I feel like that's pretty normal work hard play hard. Plenty of people not in Greek life go to frat parties. Although once you're an upperclassmen it's more common to go to friends' house parties/kickbacks or bars. There's also co-op parties which have a different vibe from frats. Obviously there's gonna be some people that are bookworms that never go out but like that could be true anywhere. Majority of people care about academics but also are chill and wanna have fun. There's so many people at this school you're bound to find people you vibe with. Some people barely study at all and are getting drunk on a Tuesday. I was a hard worker but still would always go out on weekends to bars, concerts, events etc and sometimes weekdays would go to stuff like happy hours, trivia nights, open mic, karaoke night etc. You get to decide how much time you personally wanna dedicate to studying vs social life.\n\nTaking advantage of the area definitely varies person to person, I think it goes underutilized as someone said, simply because people are busy and think they don't have time, but if you find friends that are down to go, it's super easy to go whenever. Especially cool if you make some non-freshmen friends in clubs or something cuz they probably know more cool spots around town and in Oakland/SF. If you're proactive about finding stuff to do around the bay it'll definitely make a great experience.\n\nWestwood comparatively is very boring and it's hard to get around with public transit other than just closeby areas on bus. But there's not too much nearby really, so you'll have to deal with driving places with traffic and parking. I lived in LA after graduating and it was such a pain to get around even with a car and I definitely missed Berkeley in how dense and walkable it was. It just made seeing friends and going out so much easier. In LA everything had to be planned more in advanced and you had to dedicate more time because you couldn't just walk home or take the bus/Bart back whenever like in Berkeley. Plus LA food and bars were mostly more expensive, especially on westside where UCLA is, a lot of things are pretty bougie. There's good cheap diverse food and whatnot more east, but UCLA students hardly go too far east. I personally never liked westside cuz the food was always overpriced and whitewashed. I love the food diversity in Berkeley and how so many places are small businesses rather than big chains."", ""i think everyone has mostly said everything, but i'll just corroborate and say that in my experience, it isn't hypercompetitive. I'd like to say most people go out pretty often and are able to find a balance between their personal life and school. Not sure where you heard the culture thing from but I would also say a lot of people fall in the middle and you won't struggle to find people who align with your comfort levels. Also, in general, if you go to UCLA you pretty much have to get a car to get around or go anywhere interesting unless you plan on ubering. Berkeley's transportation isn't amazing but is leaps and bounds better than what is available in LA and I can usually bart or bus to sf for day trips and concerts without a hitch."", 'Idk follow the academics bc in the end its kinda all the same college experience and choosing one over another isnt going to make or break the experience. What makes or breaks it is what you do with your time and the friends you make.', 'I’m a mom of a Cal student. Here’s my perspective for what it’s worth. \n\nUCLA is located in the Westwood/bell air area. It’s not cheap. Is it as difficult/expensive to find housing as berkeley? I don’t know. But I do know that the areas surrounding UCLA are all “nice” areas with low crime. Berkeley is very patchy. (Oakland, which is right next to berkeley, has some of the highest crime rates in California.) My son has found housing for his second year at berkeley but it was definitely stressful for his parents. I was really worried. \n\nMy son is having a blast at berkeley, but he’s one of those people who has an easy time making friends. He’s been interested in Greek life, but has decided he’s more comfortable with a “nerdy” friend group. He’s in a math/engineering club and also does a lot of sports too (not the professional kind, the kind you play with other students.) I have seen a lot of posts here in Reddit but also on the FB parent group of kids who are just miserable at berkeley, have made no friends and haven’t gotten into any clubs. \n\nMy son goes into SF occasionally but mostly I think he stays close to campus. Bart is right there and will take you to the city easily. Busses run all over berkeley. In LA you will need a car if you want to get anywhere. Public transportation is ok but it’s such a huge city getting anywhere is time consuming. (FYI I live in LA). Westwood is kind of tucked up north of Beverly Hills/Santa Monica. It’s a cute little village, but it’s not like you can walk to the clubs in WeHo from there. You can probably get on a bus and go to the beach pretty easily though. \n\nMy biggest issue with berkeley is the homeless population, which is large, generally druggie, and too frequently violent. The streets of the little downtown and much of Durant are filled with addicts. We saw a young woman passed out on the sidewalk in the middle of the day the last time we were there. Sometimes the homeless get into the dorms. I think it’s pretty safe just because the students outnumber them, but the place definitely has a rough/urban vibe, whereas UCLA, even though it’s located in a huge metropolis and it’s a huge campus, feels safer and more suburban.', 'It’s true all of it, be prepared to work a LOT more here and earn less in return (unless you apply for graduate school) when you come to this school.\n\nThe truth is, student work 1000x harder here compared to the other T20 schools (except Caltech and MIT of course) but don’t receive the same amount of output.', 'Have you visited both campuses?', 'According to Google 26% of Berkeley undergrads live in campus housing. For UCLA it’s 48%. Essentially 2 years campus living in UCLA, and 1 year for Berkeley.', ""As someone not in Greek Life, I haven't noticed any divide. Maybe it's there, but if there was one, in my experience it doesn't matter."", 'Berkeley is one of the most walkable places in California, without a doubt (saw your LA post). That\'s one perk I love about Berkeley - just north, south, and west (downtown) of campus and beyond, there\'s always more corridors to discover with coffee shops, restaurants, other small businesses. And, AC Transit buses are frequent and free for students. (I\'ve heard that in LA, there can be a stigma against taking the bus, with it being associated with lower class travel, but regardless if that\'s true or not, that doesn\'t exist here at all.)\n\nAddressing your question here -\n\nShops, stores, restaurants are right across the street from campus on Northside, Southside, and Downtown, so yes I do go into the City of Berkeley (and often farther inside the city).\n\nAs for SF, I go every once in a while - there\'s BART (faster, since it\'s a train) or AC Transit F (free). It\'s easy to get to and takes 30-60 min, depending on your transit choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf walkability *is* a huge thing for you, all else considered equal, I would certainly recommend Berkeley over LA.\n\nI chose between Berkeley & LA, though that wasn\'t my main deciding factor, it was more my academic interests and the resources they had for it (since I liked both campuses). Regarding ""ultracompetitiveness"", where\'s some truth to that, especially if applying to certain clubs. There\'ll also be times where you have to academically push yourself and work incredibly hard, but that doesn\'t mean you won\'t enjoy your time here. That\'s been true for me. And, it\'s not like you\'ll face none of this at UCLA, perhaps a little less, while also managing more midterms/finals on the quarter system.\n\nGood luck deciding, although perhaps you\'ve already decided by now!']","I'm currently choosing between Berkeley and UCLA, and the decision has not been easy. I'm leaning toward Berkeley because it's stronger in the fields I want to study (math/physics/quantum), but I'm very much put off by a couple of things I've heard about Cal. 

First, housing. Is the housing situation on campus and in the city as bad as it sounds? Does the majority off-campus living situation detract from a sense of community on campus? Will I have to struggle to find and pay through the nose for shitty apartments after Freshman year?

Next, culture. I've heard that Berkeley is quite polarized between the Greek life crowd and the more nerdy kids. I've also heard warning of the ultracompetitive atmosphere that makes it hard to enjoy one's time at school. Are these accurate or overblown? 

Last is just a question: do students tend to take advantage of Berkeley and SF on a regular basis, or do most stick closely to campus?

I'd love to hear from anyone, but specifically, hearing from current (post-COVID) students would be very valuable. If you're a math or physics student especially, please let me know you're perspective! Thanks all for taking the time to answer."

I know this is not a common thing you see at r/berkeley, but I'm serious.

When I came in as a freshman, I didn't know anything other than the school's reputation for being the best public university, academically rigorous, depressed, and meme-y (thanks UCBMFET). It was so interesting to see people who were friendly, down to have fun, chill, while being so academically inclined. I made a solid friend group (very lucky to have met them), tried out some CS classes (failing a midterm lmao), went to some career fairs with my absolute dogshit resume, and got to know the culture at Berkeley a lot more. I went from being curious about berkeley, while immersing in that jokingly depressed culture, to carving out my own tenuous piece on this place.

Fast forward to now, I'm incredibly grateful and lucky to have met some amazing people, being part of a community on campus, and have gotten through academically with a sweet job at the end (somehow). Although the professional successes feel nice (but not as nice as you think they'd be when ur a freshman), the relationships I've made with people here are what I consider most valuable. 

Some nights just made me anxious, but I decided to take it easy (esp after I declared woohoo). COVID took a hit on me, but I learned to take advantage of it. I began to take my losses as some kind of joke god was playing on me or something. My freshman friend group split off? No worries, I'll try to make some new friends. I didn't get into clubs? There probably was something wrong I said in my apps but boo they suck (ended up getting in and loving it). 

And now, looking back, I can't say I did as many crazy things as I thought I would back in hs, but damn, what an experience. I'm so glad I got to take the chance to meet the people out here and simply put myself out there to do more things. I'm p shy, but fuck it. Met some amazing people who I'm grateful to call my friends. 

As I see prospective freshmen listening to tour guides on campus, sometimes I think about reenacting a scene from Get Out, but I also wonder how they feel and how it felt when I was in their shoes. Good luck to you all in making your decisions. Berkeley's tough. You'll experience a lot of shitty moments, but you'll also experience all the golden moments on top of the pile that make it worth the journey.

My advice would be to try and treat church like a job, mentally clock in and out, and see how much you\'re actually getting ""paid"" lol. I\'d try to see about staying here in the summer if possible, don\'t cut out your parents, just slowly reduce contact as much as possible. DM me if you want to talk or vent! good luck!

Having to go to church or even a Christian club really ain't so bad of a deal to get free tuition and housing (especially if you end up just pretending to go most of the time).\n\nI think there's plenty of people who are in the same boat as you, there's really no reason you should have to feel guilty about it. Hell I knew people that had to pretend they were straight or cis all through college just so their parents wouldn't disown them/stop paying, I can't imagine how hard that is. \n\nMaybe in future summers you can do internships or research so you have a reason to not come home for more than a couple weeks. \n\nMy parents are liberal and generally supportive but sometimes when we'd fight and my mom was mad she'd threaten to stop paying my rent. Obviously I was super grateful for them supporting me financially and I was always very frugal with their money, but it was very frustrating that I always had to give in and play nice even when my mom was being super mean and toxic. I honestly don't believe she actually would've done it, so I definitely never had the fears you have to deal with, but it still just sucked having her use that against me as an excuse to act however she wants. It's definitely nice now that I've graduated and she has to treat me more equally because there's nothing she can really hold over my head.

Like some people probably think it's silly cuz it's not like they can do anything about it, but I don't really feel bothered just hiding it from them so it's just easier to not rock the boat. I also never told them I'm not religious anymore, though I don't think it would be a huge deal cuz they're barely active themselves, but I just figure there's no reason for me to mention it cuz I feel like they'd still be annoying about it.\n\nAnyway sucks that you have to deal with parents like that, I'm sure it also just doesn't feel great to fear they won't accept you for who you are, but still pretending to be religious seems like a small price to pay for a Berkeley education so imo you should just stick to it if possible.

Another tip is that if you’re opting to live off-campus next year, apply for CalFresh and visit the campus food pantry if you haven’t already. The Basic Needs Center is staffed with some people that I’ve had good experiences with when I was reaching out for help. This also might seem impossible right now depending on your income from your job, but if you can start putting away ANY amount of money into a savings account that your parents don’t have access to. No amount is too small to start. \n\nThis stuff is a supplement of course, and won’t have you fully financially independent by the time you graduate. However, as a student from a similar family situation (I’ve been graduated all of 2mo. now, lol), these actions alleviated some of my fear towards not having any personal safety net just in case the worst happened.

I’m mentally in such a better place already. I know it’s a really difficult decision to make. Not sure if your family is as crazy as mine but maybe they will listen to your point of view? Accept you for who you are? Because if you keep kicking the can down the road and letting them control your life, you could end up regretting it. Just something to think about.', 'I’ll get hate for this, but I don’t care. They’re right that you shouldn’t smoke.

Crazy, lol.  \nBut they‘re 100% making mistakes if this is how you feel about them. Maybe it’s a track record of imposing rules that were insufficiently explained or downright illogical? They sound a little extreme with that “darkness of Satan“ line.

You know what you have to do long term. Pursue that financial freedom. I don’t think it’s wise to take the full tuition burden onto yourself, but it would definitely light a fire under your ass if you go that way.

I’m a rising sophomore this year. I loved my first year at cal. I worked my ass off to get into this school and I really felt like I came alive in my studies and being away from home.

My parents, however, are not thrilled that I’m here. They pressured me into going to a christian school (which didn’t even offer my major), and expressed deep disappointment in the fact that I wanted to go to a secular university. 

They’re extremely conservative fundamentalist christians who believe that the bay is godless and, in their words, “shrouded in the darkness of satan” (I’m from a small conservative farm town in california). No matter what I do, they aren’t happy with me— even when I was a believer it was like this. I lost my faith in high school but hid this from them because they are extremely volatile people and I didn’t feel safe sharing this with them. My only sanity has been moving away from home and focusing on my studies and making friends who can expand and challenge my view of the world. 
However, I’ve been living back at home for the summer, and the extent of their mental abuse has only gotten worse. They essentially found out that I smoke on occasion and made me promise to “change” otherwise I would be cut off financially. Mind you, I maintained a 3.8 GPA my first year while also working a part time job. Smoking didn’t affect my studies, and perhaps I’d understand them if it did… but it didn’t, lol. 

Without their support, I would be unable to afford this school. I am fortunate enough that they will be covering all but a few thousand dollars in loans, but for that reason I get essentially no financial aid. If I lose their support, I will either be put into extreme debt paying for full tuition or be forced to drop out, which would devastate me. I feel like I’ve come this far dealing with their narcissistic mind games, but financial abuse is new to them. I have an amazing friend group and enough self esteem not to let this get to me too deeply, but it’s draining to imagine 3 more years of pretending to be someone I’m not for them. 

I’m also so, so frustrated. It feels like everyone else here got to go to college and become an adult, while I still get treated like a child whose life decisions don’t even get to be decided by me. This whole situation makes me feel like a pet stuck in a cage.

It also makes me feel manipulative— does it make me a bad person to pretend to be a Christian so they will continue to pay for my schooling? I don’t think it’s possible for me to gain financial freedom; not only would I not feel safe imagining what their reaction would be, but I would not be able to support myself. Basically, I want to know that I’m making the right choice. I plan on joining a church to appease them and otherwise keeping my emotional distance, because I have to live my own life at some point but I’m not quite able to to yet. Am I being selfish? Does anyone else have crazy toxic parents here? 🥲 

sorry for the wall of text, but even shouting into the void makes me feel better. go bears <3

Edit: thank you all so much for the encouragement and kind words. I really thought I was losing my mind haha. I know I’m not the first nor the last to experience a home life like this but it means so much to actually hear from others who’ve come out of my same situation. endless love to everyone who’s shared their thoughts & advice, you’ve helped make my bad day a lot better :)

This affords you the ability to know many people in your classes and in the college which is very nice. It’s a great feeling to know who’s walking around and have people to talk about classes with.\n\nAdvising is more accessible, not sure about the quality comparison though. I can always get an appointment same day or next day and they’re very responsive through emails. My advisor also knows my name and remembers my history well. You also have a separate faculty advisor who is a professor you can check in with too.\n\nResearch is readily available if you apply yourself and go for it from the CoC. If you just grind a bit and send out emails and show interest, you’re bound to find somewhere that will take you in. I wasn’t interested in research, but all my friends who were got positions.\n\nAlso to address a previous comment, I don’t think the college is cutthroat. It’s small and challenging yes, but there is a culture/superiority complex of shared suffering. It drives people to be friendly and help each other because it’s very academic. People are generally willing to help out (of course exceptions apply).\n\nBe careful who you sit next to the first day in Chem 4A, they could end up being your best friends.', 'I feel like it all depends on how you approach it. I know a friend in CoC, and despite it being a ""cut throat college,"" he is able to talk with his advisor and professors for help and research. Obviously, he places a lot of time and effort to making those connections, but my point here is that it is definitely possible to get help in CoC. \n\nIf you make the conscious effort to reach out to people, you will be fine. It\'s also easier when things are in person. \n\nI\'d advise you to not be too worried.', 'I\'m second year chemE and can answer some of your questions – yes, the college is very small (there\'s \\~250 per class which drops to like 200 by sophomore year) so you get to know the names of a lot of your peers. However, the advising at least in my experience has been garbage – the advisors don\'t really have any clue about chemistry and don\'t know what\'s best for you. Your best bet is to talk to upperclassmen (clubs are a good way to meet them); they are more than willing to let you know what classes are useful, provide insights on research, etc. I do think UG research is a little easier to get into than maybe for someone in L&S since there are quite a few CoC labs (see the website if interested) who are probably more interested in taking Chem/CBE students as opposed to say, MCB students. For your last point, classes are actually not too difficult in content and you can do well if you attend lectures, do HWs diligently, and practice for exams, but imo the thing that actually makes it hard/stressful is that you usually have to take 3-4 technical classes per semester, meaning you can\'t afford to put >12-15 hours in one class (or if you do, then you may not do as well in other classes or end up coming away with a poorer understanding than if you could devote said time). I would not characterize the environment as cutthroat whatsoever; the reality is that most people are getting f\\*cked in the sense that they are usually confused about or behind on the content, and therefore this breeds a collaborative environment where people often seek help and others are willing to assist. Of course, everyone here still wants to do well , and some classes are graded on curves, so I\'d say it\'s reasonable to call it competitive, but I think it pushes you to be better. Having to ""fend for themselves,"" not so much.']","Hi everyone! I was (very shockingly) admitted to UC Berkeley yesterday for chemical engineering!

My mom got her undergrad degree (BS in neuroscience) at Berkeley in the 80's and has always warned me and my sister about it. She said her experience was really impersonal and that she never felt like any advisor or faculty cared about her. 

However, while I was researching the College of Chemistry late last night, I've seen some info about how the college is quite small and that becuase of that, advising is pretty decent compared to UC Berkeley as a whole. Is this true? Is being part of the college of chemistry a more intimate college experience? Can undergraduates acess research opportunities more easily than students of the college of L&S? I know that UCB has a reputation of being this really hard, massive school where everyone has to fend for themselves (tbh my mom has definetly promoted this idea), but was wondering if my experience in the CoC would be different"

2022-09-24,07:34:04,"[vent/need advice] Gamers @ Berkeley, Time Management + Setting Priorities Straight",https://reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xmma1o/ventneed_advice_gamers_berkeley_time_management/,"['Advice from a fellow gamer:\n\n1) train yourself to stay on task when you need to using environmental context. Never play video games at the same desk you study at. Never study at the same place you play video games at. This method has been EXTREMELY useful for me and helps me subconsciously avoid spending too much time I don’t have on gaming.\n\n2) force yourself to finish all of your work before gaming. Don’t play games while you have looming unmet deadlines.\n\n3) whenever you can, try to play with friends or people you find on the various Berkeley gaming discords. If your friends stop playing for the day, so should you at the same time. Especially try to play with people you know effectively balance their gaming and social/studying life; following this tip means you “offload” your bad habits onto someone who is better in control. \n\nDo those 3 things, and gaming - even with a video game addiction - is very manageable. I especially HIGHLY recommend tip 1; it has been extremely helpful for me and it rewires my brain to make gaming not much of an issue when I need it not to be. Another important aspect of tip 1: even if you find yourself giving in to the urge to be unproductive, to watch TV, to play video games, force yourself to leave your study desk before you do it. If you compartmentalize your behavior based on physical location you can use those locations to study when you absolutely have to.\n\nIf you’re in the dorms, go on campus to a library to study. Try to leave your headphones at home, so you can’t watch videos if you wanted to. That’s what I did last year to force myself to study. & when I was in the dorms I was fine to play games because most of the time I had all my work and studying done before then.', ""Hey buddy, I just thought of it like this: if I can no life a game and put in that much work, I can do the same for the real world. And the real world is the best video game, seriously.\n\nI stopped playing games like Tarkov or ESO or Warframe that require a grind to be good, and enjoy more in the moment games like squad or league or satisfactory etc.\n\nI edged my way off, I didn't cut it off. Worked my way down from playing as much."", ""You sound a lot like me when I was a freshman.  Not to scare you or anything, but i wound up withdrawing twice before I learned effective strategies for self-regulating.\n\nHave you been evaluated for ADHD?  Like I said, you sound a lot like me, and I've got ADHD.\n\nGo look up the difference between addiction and compulsion.  Based on what you described, your behavior sounds more compulsive than addictive.\n\nI would suggest two things based on my experience: accept that distractions aren't a personal failing, and dedicate a specific time to your gaming interests.  The second may sound strange, but with compulsive behavior, what matters is that you get the hit, and it also is terrible for mental health to deny yourself recreation.  If you're like me too, doing the problem sets can easily expand to consume your entire day if you allow them to, and so giving yourself a narrower window to complete them in can actually make you more productive.  For myself, I stopped working after 9pm; enough time to satisfy my recreational needs, and also the time at which my mental performance would decline significantly."", ""As a graduate, I find myself gravitating toward video games when I'm not working toward any goals or if I'm not busy. And I've played a lot of video games - as I kid I'd spend 12+ hours a day playing MMOs and RPGs, especially during summer vacations. \n\nFor me personally, the only thing that worked was to quit cold turkey and replace them with a tangible goal. I wanted to get a decent job out of college, so I instead directed my focus toward getting good grades, finding relevant work experience, and incrementally working towards that goal. Now that I have a job, I have other goals and aspirations I'm slowly working towards. Every now and then I find myself playing games again - but it never devolves into an obsession like in the past. I still listen to people playing games on Youtube and Twitch as background noise, and I've found this scratches my itch enough."", 'Wow you sound just like me lol. Luckily I could get away with 8 hours a day of gaming in HS since it was online cuz of covid, but limiting is definitely necessary at Berkeley, especially since classes are all in-person now. My suggestions would be:\n\n1. Set a timer (ex. you can only play up to 3 hours a day)\n2. Keep the ""hw first, game second"" mindset (i.e. finish all of today\'s work before playing)\n3. Take harder classes -- if you take more units/harder classes/more clubs, you naturally start to not care as much about gaming. Not sure if it works for everyone, but it might be worth trying.\n\nBy the way, I find watching videos of pros to be fairly effective for ""getting good"" if you can find patterns in what exactly the pros are doing in order to win. Again, make sure you set rules to limit yourself (ex. watch only 1 video per day, only watch during bus rides, etc.)', 'Video game addiction is a real problem that can affect your dopamine levels and decrease enjoyment in other things. If it is distracting you this much you should seek out some professional help to guide you through your weening process.', 'One thing that worked for me (someone who’s generally not super focused) is bringing my switch or having a game on my laptop in a library or something, then setting up a timer and studying for like 1.5-2hrs, taking a half hour break to game, study another few hours, rinse repeat. I would’ve wasted my break time on social media or YouTube or something anyway so at least doing something I enjoy in my recharge time meant I could get stuff done while also enjoying my favorite hobby.']","For any gamers at Berkeley, do you think that playing videogames while balancing schoolwork is difficult? Is it simply not feasible / worth it to play videogames anymore?

For context, throughout high school I was only allowed to play videogames on weekends. I played games like counter strike that require a lot of practice in mechanical and decision-making skills, and to me the grind was rewarding. It was also a way to connect with friends I had made online and the wider gaming community as a whole. Now, anyone that has played these multiplayer games also knows the opposite of rewarding exists: getting tilted at your own bad performance in games, getting yelled at by toxic teammates, other random bullshittery outside your control.

Even when I couldn't play during the weekdays, I could only think about video games and ""getting gud"". I couldn't focus on homework and I frequently watched video game content/tutorials or other random youtube garbage until I couldn't procrastinate any longer, or else I would have very little sleep the next day. I had shit time management for the longest time. To this day, I don't even know how I survived HS and ended up here LOL. My parents warned me that college would be the busiest years of life. And then comes your job and career. An endless spiral of slaving away. If I barely scraped by in HS, how will I survive here and in the future?

I've tried quitting video games before--I've beat myself up over it numerous times, including uninstalling the game and blocking any gaming content from youtube. When I finally have free time though, such as during the summer, I come crawling back to video games. I've tried other hobbies and things like watching anime but I just get so bored doing those things.

Right now I still have the desire to play, but I didn't bring a pc to play on to college (I only have a work computer). Instead of doing psets or whatever, I find myself easily distracted and watching youtube. I know that if I fail my classes, I would just be wasting my time here and my parents would probably disown me. I do think the content in my classes are very challenging and interesting, but my mind wanders easily to video games. I am justifying my hobby as also a way for me to blow off steam from stress with what ever I'm dealing with, and at this point I feel that gaming is a big part of my life. But maybe it's taking over my life. Perhaps I need a shift in perspective.

Thank you for reading through my incoherent and probably delusional rant, and any advice would be appreciated. <3

But it’s a weird old Italian man living in Berkeley alone, around 60yrs old, white hair, wearing a hat 🎩 like this with a “10/6” written on it. He keeps assaulting Asian girls(esp Chinese girls because he can speak Chinese) by chatting/“befriending” them.  

1. My friend met him on telegraph ave. My friend was wearing a pink dress, and this older man started to talk with her and said she was so pretty and looked like Alice from wonderland, and compared himself to the man hatter. My friend thanked him, and this man asked her if she was Chinese and kept talking with her in Chinese. (He seems to be a lovely and knowledgeable person who can speak many languages) And they talked a lot about culture/ politics/ etc... Then this man invited her to drink tea at his place. (Ik super creepy, but my friend is an innocent and kind exchange student who just came to the states)

2. My friend asked me if I wanted to go with her to this man’s place in Berkeley cuz she thought it was just a kind and friendly Italian “grandpa” who read a lot and into Chinese culture and history. But she’s afraid to go alone, so I went with her. We had an excellent talk, and this older man seemed friendly and showed us his books/collections/… He told us about his mysterious life experience in China like Matteo Ricci, read fortune for us, and even lent us some books(We thought he was just a kind older man living alone without any friends, and we even plan to give him some Chinese postcards as a gift ). 

3. After we returned, this man kept sending us some SUPER creepy messages. He even said he wanted my friend to “exchange as his wife” / “He fell in love with me and wants to kiss me when he’s looking at me”/ He can take care of us with his social security income….” (And some words that even worse) We were shocked and blocked him and warned him to stay away from us or we will call the police. However, another friend of mine (also Chinese) said this old man was also trying to talk to her just after a few days. 

Idk how many girls have encountered this old man?  I was reading books in a bookstore with my guy friend today, and this old man even dared to act as nth happened and said hello to me again in a cheesy way. I didn’t realize it was him before he left since I hadn’t seen him in months and I was chatting with my friend. After this, I felt really angry and gross but IDK if I could do anything with it. I am even traumatized by this type of hat🎩 . I just want to know if there's anyone in Berkeley who met this old man before? What can I do to report this man or just avoid seeing him again?
Plz help spread this message to Asian communities esp to Chinese people! I hope ROSS .S get what he deserved"

This message is to inform you of two important changes to L&S CS graduation requirements.

* ***Effective immediately***: A grade of P in EECS16B earned during Spring 2022 will satisfy the graduation requirements for L&S CS for all students, regardless of graduation year. 
* ***Pending approval*** from the College of Letters and Sciences: The EECS16B graduation requirement may be removed entirely for L&S CS students. We anticipate that this decision will be made by L&S between April 5th and 8th. We have no indication whether L&S will accept this proposal, so do not drop the class assuming that it will be approved.

**Please note that if you opt to P/NP a course, you must earn a grade of C- or better to receive a P.** In other words, if you change from a letter grade to P/NP, and earn a D+, you will receive a grade of NP. A grade of NP is not sufficient to graduate. 

Warning: In Spring 2021, during the period of special pandemic exceptions, many students changed their grading option to P/NP and earned a grade of D. Such students were thus given an NP.  Late petitions to convert a grade back from NP to a grade of D were denied by L&S, in some cases delaying graduation. We anticipate any such late petitions will be denied again.

**Do not contact me, the EECS16B staff, or the EECS16B professors for questions or clarifications about this policy change.**

**For questions or clarifications, email either Director of Undergraduate Affairs Antoine Davis** at [antoined@eecs.berkeley.edu](mailto:antoined@eecs.berkeley.edu) **or the cs-advising team** at [cs-advising@eecs.berkeley.edu](mailto:cs-advising@eecs.berkeley.edu).

Clarifications:

* This policy has no impact on EECS students, i.e. EECS students must still take EECS16B for a letter grade, and the course will continue to be required for the EECS major.
* The P/NP change in this policy applies only to L&S CS students taking EECS16B during the Spring 2022 semester, and has no impact on the letter grade requirement for EECS16B taken in any other semester, past or future.
* This policy has no impact on graduation requirements for other L&S majors.

However, right as I went through the metal detectors, one of the guards stopped me and asked if I was a student here. I said yes and he told me to go back out and turn the corner to go through the student entrance instead. I did what he said and arrived at where I think it was the student entrance, it just said gate 6 or something so I wasn't sure, but it didn't look like it was open since the doors were closed and there was nobody checking for vaccine cards like they did at the front entrance or the employee entrance right next to gate 6. So I asked the guards at the employee entrance where the student entrance was, they just looked at me in confusion and then said, ""oh, just come through this way, its fine."" I then somehow ended in some kind of backstage area of the stadium and ended up going through the doors where the players would come through during the game.

I’m sure there were real bad feelings afterward; PTSD is definitely a real thing. \n\nHere’s the blunt part: in my experience, people who feel seriously upset about situations they don’t experience (I.e have only read about) are reading too much and doing too little. There’s benefit from getting more directly involved in trying to help. Yes, there’s a limit to what you’ll be able to do.

We had to interview with the company who had reviewed our resume before being accepted in to the Global Internships program.\n* We also ran into visa issues which delayed our internship start by a week. Our in-person classes were also supposed to take place every Monday; with the visa issue, our in-person class was changed to happen for a full week, giving us more flexibility on the weekend.\n* Both our Berkeley advisor and local advisor were very responsive. The two worked well together and managed to hear about any issues that arose and were proactive about it. Unfortunately, this particular Berkeley advisor has moved on to another role.\n* I think the cost varied depending on country. I was also offered several scholarships that both our advisors had found and applied for us. My internship was also paid, and I ended up coming back home above net albeit only 10 USD.\n* My program included housing; however, for my in-person class, I had a roommate with student housing.\n* I am in STEM and this experience helped me kickstart my career as an in-between with the research experience I had and the corporate experience I would get.\n\nI would not have done this program if I did not have an offer from a company before having to decide/pay.

I’m not sure, but it sounds like they promised much less than they delivered (on purpose too it seems like).', '[deleted]', 'I just applied to the London internship for summer 2024. how would you say your experience was after actually completing the internship?']","Feeling a little frustrated and disappointed atm so decided to share my experiences with other students because I could not find any meaningful information about the Global Internships program myself before I unfortunately signed up and would like to warn others about potentially doing the same.

A few months ago, I attended some information sessions about the program and was very interested in going to London this summer. I specifically chose this program because I wanted to gain work experience abroad and love the city. This program guarantees an internship placement in your field of choice and has a lengthy information form and interview process you have to complete to assess your desired placement areas. Additionally, students also get housing for the summer and are enrolled in two required summer courses (one online, one in person). Berkeley’s program provider partner for the London Global Internships is this company called Anglo Educational Services (AES). This program seemed very legit and was marketed very well, with slideshows and the main facilitators of the program answering student questions and the Berkeley program adviser (Breanne) there as well. Needless to say, it was hyped up as a great experience that could be used as a building block in forming professional contacts overseas and I, along with many other students, was excited to participate this summer. 

This was back in late February/early March. To put it mildly, this whole process has been a complete shit show and not at all what I signed up for:

•Visas: the people at AES took several weeks to issue the basic student numbers needed to begin the application process for student visas for the summer. Because of this, we have all been scrambling around to set up appointment dates for the visa process in time for the start of the program this summer. These numbers were issued so late that the program is supposed to start in a few days and not everyone has their passport back with their visa in it yet.

•Housing: AES doesn’t disclose anything about your living situation until you actually arrive on site. They give a building address and that’s about it. They won’t let you know in advance how many people you will share a room/suite with or who they are. They randomly assign roommates and don’t take into account living preferences while doing so, so it’s on you to find other students in the program that have similar habits etc. And even roommate requests are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

•Classes: at the outset of this program, we were told that our in person class (which meets twice a week) will be scheduled on Friday mornings and Monday afternoons, so that we could take full advantage of our location in London to travel during the weekends (such as other places in the UK or Europe). We are strictly not allowed to miss a single class or internship work day during this program, so this free time over the weekend is crucial to any other tourism we might want to do over summer. We could therefore travel Friday afternoon after class and travel back on Monday morning before class, giving us two full days on Saturday and Sunday to sightsee. Anyways, AES recently came out with the class schedule and they booked classes for early Monday morning, which means we only have a full day on Saturday to be anywhere else and will have to travel back on Sunday afternoon/evening. This is really disappointing to a lot of us since you can’t really do a proper weekend trip with only one full day to be someplace. When another student emailed AES about this, they said something along the lines of “sometimes life doesn’t work out the way you want it to.” Like what does that mean??

•Internship: Similar to the visa numbers, AES is taking forever to provide internship placements. The internship roles are due to start exactly one week from today, and there are multiple students that still haven’t had a single interview for a intern position. I received my first one just yesterday. This is totally not what they told us at the beginning, that we would know at the end of May at the LATEST what placement offer we would receive. They also said that we had the option to request an alternative placement up to two additional times (three total different offers) if we weren’t satisfied with the initial placement option. When I emailed them expressing that I respectfully didn’t feel that the nonprofit they put me in actually reflected what I said I wanted to do in my application, they said that “while we say we can give other opportunities, these are only if you reject the internship offer for legitimate reasons” and that they “wouldn’t be able to find [me] another opportunity at this late notice.” Wtf? Are my completely different interests not a valid reason to request an alternative? The only reason it is “late notice” is because they took so long to issue a placement offer in the first place, that’s on them. Like come on, the internship is the main sell of the program and you can’t even provide students with something that they’d like to do? Imo they should NOT go around telling students that they can request alternative placements if that’s not what they’re willing to do.

•Advising: another main sell of the program is that you would have access to advising and counseling from the program providers throughout the whole process. As noted above, they have been incredibly unhelpful this entire time, even responding to emails and questions a bit snarkily and dismissively. Everyone seems to be on their own with this. They flat out don’t disclose important details ahead of time.

Bear in mind that this costs over a semester’s worth of tuition and Berkeley Study Abroad refuses to refund anything after March 28th. This is extremely unfair given that this whole study abroad process had barely even begun by then. Had I known what I know now about this program, there is no way I would have signed up. If we are experiencing this many problems before the program has even started, I can’t imagine what the rest of this summer will look like. I have talked to other students in the program and we are all extremely disappointed at how this is shaping up to be. For the amount of money drained into this program, I honestly think that it would have been better to just sign up for two online classes that are at least related to my major and found myself volunteer work through cold emailing. All I can do for now is just go along with it so I don’t lose the thousands of dollars that they will not refund. What can I say, it’s incredibly frustrating and I feel completely lied to, given that they said one thing during applications and another during this whole process. Don’t make the same mistake I did by trusting these people."

Sadly, I didn't start it earlier because I was bogged down by job/internship interviews and depression and welp, when I started it on Monday, 7 days before the deadline, I found it was indeed hard and long AF. I went to an hour of office hours (1:1 time with the prof) and still didn't get all of my questions answered.

I...have a GPA around 3.7 or so, and I believe that it won't affect me for jobs and stuff. Moreover, I am not planning on grad school in this field, but it's just wow, I had to fuck it up at the end when I was so close. Sigh.

I know this is far from the worst problem anyone can have, but sigh."

2021-02-27,17:22:06,Profile Evaluation for MS in Civil Engineering at Berkeley,https://reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ltsrdj/profile_evaluation_for_ms_in_civil_engineering_at/,['[deleted]'],"(Long Post Warning)

Hey Guys,

I definitely realize that this is not exactly the right forum to talk about this. But it would be great if current grad students at the CEE department can give me their thoughts.

 I'm an international student applying for Fall'21 for the MS in Civil Engineering course, concentration on Structures at Berkeley.  My GPA is a 3.7/4, GRE is a 164Q and 162V and 5 AWA. 2 ongoing literature review papers as first author in the structural engineering field. The first of which has now been accepted at an international conference, the proceedings of which gets published by Springer (SCOPUS Indexed). I've also done a small research project as part of my course curriculum. I've done 2 strong summer internships, one at an MNC construction company and another at a nationally renowned consultant firm. I have 5 strong LoRs, 4 from my professors and one from the consultant internship. Apart from this, I have very strong extra and co-curriculars. One noteworthy co-curricular is working as a student leader for the alumni association in my college, coordinating their initiatives and funds to better the infrastructure at the college.

&#x200B;

I would like to receive honest comments on what my chances are at being accepted at Berkeley. Do international students with similar credentials normally get in? I am extremely anxious waiting for the decision."
2022-12-07,03:19:38,Is it worth it to actually write about my hardships on my application for UCB grad school ?,https://reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zeqmph/is_it_worth_it_to_actually_write_about_my/,"['1) Yes, you should apply.\n2) What do your letter writers think?', 'Dude, HUGE CONGRATS TO YOU for turning your life around regardless of the ultimate outcome of this. Definitely include the story, but frame it from a growth perspective!', 'Currently doing Masters of Engineering in Bioengineering here! First of all, huge respect for you and what you went through. My biggest advice for grad app writing is definitely narrative and fit. You’ve been through so much struggles that it’s hard to mention everything and like you said, you’re not all defined by those moments. I would do more research on what the specific program you want to apply is and construct a narrative on how (if at all) overcoming these obstacles has led you on the path you’re pursuing (potentially with this degree). It would then be reframed as presenting your motivation for application and what the program could offer. If the admission office does not see a good fit and accept you for your story, you’re probably better off with another program that’s a better fit for you anyway.']","Warning, lost post ahead, but I figured it’s important to provide my academic record before getting into my hardships. I only give my academic history so I can get an accurate idea of whether or not  it’s even remotely possible for me to get into Berkeley:

I’m a biomedical engineering major with a CS minor from UT Dallas/Ut Austin, and I’m applying to Berkeley’s electrical engineering masters program (I graduate next semester). 

I barely have a 3.0 GPA (sometimes 2.98-2.99 depending on the semester), but I have 3 very strong letters of recommendation: 2 from professors that I’m doing research with, and one professor who I had for senior level biophotonics. All 3 are engineering professors who do a lot of research. One went to Stanford and worked at T.I., and the other two went to tsinghua in China. The main BMEN/EE internship I’ve been doing is at the neuroimaging research center of a fairly major medical school/hospital system (UT Southwestern). My main areas of focus there are MRI reconstruction software design and applications for machine learning in neuroimaging. The other research I’m doing through UTSW/parkland medical center is on the topic of using machine learning for object identification in vascular ultrasound. 

I also have quite an extensive background in the visual arts (10+yrs of doing photography/film semi professionally), and I’m a self taught classical pianist who has gotten up to ABRSM diploma level in 2 years. Eventually I plan to audition for a piano undergrad program. Overall I take pride in being an autodidact in many different types of arts and sciences. 

My GPA for my senior/2nd semester junior classes is 3.4-3.5, and my CS minor GPA is over a 3.7, but I really messed up for a semester during COVID and also freshman year. So normally I’d never apply to a place like Berkeley w/ a 3.0, but on top of my strong letters of Rec I also have a pretty insane life story, and I noticed on the UCB app it asks about hardships that you’ve overcome. I want to write about my life honestly, but I’m also a little worried that it will just make the admissions office even more disgusted with my application…

Hardships: from age 17-20 I had a major problem with drugs, overdosed several times, had to withdraw from UT Austin cockrell due to the epilepsy I gave myself from taking so many pills, was homeless for 4 months while working construction just to get food, went to rehab for another 5 months, worked in food service for a year, wanted to just do photography/film and not go to college until I realized that I should at least try to use the natural gifts I’ve always had for science/math. 

Initially I had no confidence in my abilities, was highly depressed and totally isolated , failed some stuff freshman/sophomore year, had a mental breakdown, got therapy, binge watched all the Stanford lectures on quantum mechanics and realized that I wanted to be an scientist again (regardless of how hard it would be), started getting into programming by getting addicted to MIT Open courseware videos on data structures/algorithms and the famous MIT OCW lectures on artificial intelligence, then I decided to sign up for a computer science minor as well as my BMEN major. 

Eventually junior year I hit my stride/gained confidence and I’m now I’m position where my professors, and my parents (who are academics) are all telling me I should apply to some top level engineering schools for my masters. I feel like I genuinely have something to offer as far as being an engineer.

The problem is that I’m very much on the fence about telling my life story in the essay. I have a lot of other things to talk about, such as my research, research interests, and my artistic endeavors. I’m worried that talking about how fucked up I was will just make the people at UCB admissions even more likely to reject me. I know the application asks for you to talk about hardships, but this seems like the type of hardship that I should just keep inside. In many ways a lot of the problems I had were my own fault. I am not economically or socially disadvantaged. 

I’m also a fairly good writer + good in interviews so maybe those two things will help as well. But overall I’m wondering if 1): I should apply at all and 2): if I should write about my struggle with drugs. I don’t think I have a shot either way, but I’ve wanted to Berkeley since
I was in 8th grade and this is basically my last chance. 

I hate to use a sob story to try and get in, especially one that makes me look unstable, but at the same time in a strange way I’m proud of how much I’ve overcome. Normally I’d never talk about it in a million years, but since the application is asking I figured it it may be worth a shot. 

Sorry for such a garrulous post, but I had to get all this off my chest before I start writing my personal statement."

You could also try to sublease your room for the spring semester, lots of international exchange students start looking early.']","Warning: this is pretty long and contains some stuff I’ve had bottled up for a while. I’m also not feeling great right now due to school stress, EC stress, sleep deprivation stress, stress from the situation I’m about to describe, so it might come off as whiny.

I’ve recently not been happy with my living situation with respect to my roommates. (I’m been living with them for about two years.) One of them, Person A, reached out to me early in school, and at first I was pretty happy, since 1. I was worried about not getting a dorm from Berkeley, and 2. I didn’t think I would find anyone to room with me, since I’m a fairly reclusive person. The rent was cheap, and they seemed fine talking to me, which is a big plus as I’ve had trouble keeping friendly relationships of any sort in the past. (Long story… I’ve been ditched by a lot of people, and the few friendships that remained were fun for me, but they’ve petered out since I left high school. And they weren’t that close to begin with, even if I was able to talk with them about a diverse array of topics. I really miss being able to do that… but that’s neither here nor there, I guess.) So I moved in with them, and two other people I didn’t know. And we’ve been sharing this apartment for a while.

I’d like to say that my time here was all gravy and roses or whatever else, but it really wasn’t. A, B, and C are all pretty friendly with me sometimes—we’ve had conversations that were pretty interesting and fun—but my whole time here has still been tainted with a kind of awkwardness. Sometimes they’re talking and become quiet when I enter the room. To picture it, you can imagine one of those times when someone verbally acknowledges how awkward it is—an “ummm, awkward!” type of mood. It hasn’t gone away over the years, either—if anything, it’s increased. 

Since the first year—probably within the first few months, actually—I knew that the atmosphere would be off. I’m not all that similar to A, B, and C, so I often don’t make conversation with them and vice versa. And Person A, the one who asked me to join the group in the first place, has repeatedly asked me if I might consider finding a studio apartment, saying that it might be a better fit for me. Which is fine, I guess… I told them that I wasn’t able to find a single room apartment I liked the price of to begin with. Except that they’ve brought it up several times since then. Maybe they didn’t remember what I said to them, which again is fine, because I don’t expect everyone to remember everything I say. But I’ve given the same answer again and again, and the last time they brought it up wasn’t that long ago. At this point, it should have stuck, right? I’m just getting an odd feeling about them bringing it up so many times when I’ve repeatedly said that it isn’t monetarily easy for me. And if they do mean it as a pointed hint, I resent that they would try to frame it as a nice thing for me instead of a way for them to get me to leave without feeling like they chased me off. I don’t know if this is my pessimism talking or not. 

A few days ago, Person A “officially” told me that they were all planning to split up. (That was actually the last time they talked with me about potentially finding a studio apartment. They even offered to help me look along with the other roommates.) Now, that’s fine with me. People split up all the time and find new roommates, and we’ve been together for two years. But… they had already kind of been talking about splitting up before consulting me. I would be doing my homework in the room I share with Person B, and one of them would kind of just wander in and talk with the other about their plans for leaving. I did actually confront them about this later, but they said that they hadn’t made concrete plans, so they didn’t tell me before they solidified their ideas. (Looking back, I guess that’s reasonable. No need to tell me stuff that hasn’t been set in stone yet. But as the fourth renter… I really would have liked to know if even one of them was considering, just because it would shake up the apartment a little). Even then, I don’t think that’s necessarily malicious, but that night I kind of heard them discussing together in a hushed sort of tone in the living room. It stood out to me because they’re usually pretty loud when they talk together, and I overheard Person A talking about the conversation I had with them, regarding me eventually finding a studio apartment. I wouldn’t normally think that’s weird, but the hushed voices… that stood out to me as odd. They really don’t talk that quietly, even when I’m doing the same sort of thing I usually do away from them—studying, entertainment. They moved away from that topic and immediately resumed conversation with louder voices, so I assume it had to do with the topic and not some bizarre sudden respect for me potentially studying. (Days after my midterms, which they asked me about.) That kind of was the final straw for me. It seems so little when I write it out, but I really dislike my living situation, etc. being talked about by others while I’m not involved in the conversation. Even if Person A might have provided a reason for them to talk about it with the “helping me find a new apartment” thing, the hush-hush thing is still weird to me. Would there ever be a good reason to keep your voice down while talking in a group about another person’s apartment situation? Especially if they lived with you and were presumably distracted? I definitely was not aware that they were talking about me until I noticed the change in their tone. 

I know my roommate situation could be a lot worse… but I also kind of wish I hadn’t jumped at the first person to offer me housing. Even if it was a lot easier than trying to find a single apartment by myself. Even if I was pretty friendly with them, and thought it was as good a deal as I might get. I just want to wash my hands of them already, but I really don’t want to uproot myself in the midst of a semester. (Plus, it would be awkward to explain to my family why I’m leaving a supposedly stable roommate situation for a single.) And I would honestly feel bad about leaving the three of them to pay rent by themselves. I so badly wish I could just teleport or something out of here into a nice single room apartment so I can get the stress of my living situation out of my mind, because I have so much stress already. But I know it’s not like it’ll be better for me to leave before the time we’re splitting up. (I imagine if I were to explicitly talk to them about any of this, they would see it completely differently. Not to mention how much more awkward it would get for the next two or so semesters I’m spending with them. As I’m writing this, I’m remembering that Person B helped me make a program for generating random strings of DNA/RNA just a week or so ago, so I feel both guilty and upset.)

If anyone has comments, or suggestions, or commiseration to offer, please reply.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my lease ends sometime May next year. I talked with them a little about leaving early, and that’s what they responded with."
